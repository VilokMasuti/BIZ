Responsive Design Implementation
Project Overview
This project is a responsive web design implemented using React.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes. The goal was to recreate the given design while maintaining code reusability, accessibility, and performance optimization.

Tech Stack
React.js â€“ Component-based UI development
Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first styling for flexibility and responsiveness
MUI (Optional) â€“ Used where necessary for UI enhancements
Features
âœ… Fully responsive across different screen sizes
âœ… Modular and reusable components
âœ… Optimized performance and accessibility
âœ… Proper spacing, typography, and alignment

Challenges & Considerations
During development, I faced some personal family issues, which affected the final refinements. Additionally, not having access to the Figma file made it difficult to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy. Given more time and the exact design reference, I would be happy to make further improvements.

Future Improvements
ðŸš€ Enhance UI Accuracy if the Figma file is provided
ðŸš€ Fine-tune spacing & typography to match the original design better
ðŸš€ Add more accessibility enhancements

Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience, and despite the challenges, I ensured that the core requirements were met. I would appreciate any feedback and would be happy to make refinements if needed!
