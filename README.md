Make sure your README includes:
✅ Setup instructions (npm install && npm start)
✅ Tech stack details (React, Tailwind, MUI)
✅ Any known issues or future improvements

If you're facing family issues and need extra time, you could communicate this professionally:

"I appreciate the feedback! Given more time and access to the exact design file, I could refine the UI further. If possible, I’d love to make final tweaks to better match expectations. Let me know if that works!"
